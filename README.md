# hi there
Quite some time ago i used to work with low level programming and did things like restoring save files for friends and actually played around with embedded programming. However, due to some life challenges, I never picked it up again and I just gave up. So right here I realizewd that I actually missed doing what I did. Just playing around with files and trying to relearn stuff.
